#Smart contract
The "MyToken" contract is a basic implementation of an ERC-20 compatible token on the Ethereum blockchain.
Its primary purpose is to create a customizable token with functionalities for minting and burning tokens, 
as well as tracking token balances for different addresses.

##Description
The "MyToken" contract is designed to serve as a foundational template for creating ERC-20 compatible tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. 
It provides essential functionalities for token creation, including minting and burning tokens, along with features to track token balances for different addresses. 
With customizable variables for token name, symbol, and total supply, developers can easily deploy and manage their own token ecosystems tailored to specific use cases. 
This contract is particularly useful for projects seeking to launch their own cryptocurrencies, tokenize assets, or create utility tokens for decentralized 
applications (dApps). By leveraging the solidity code provided in the "MyToken" contract, developers can accelerate the token creation process while ensuring compliance 
with ERC-20 standards and interoperability with existing Ethereum-based services and platforms.

#Getting Started
##Installing
-To use the "MyToken" contract, you can deploy it to the Ethereum blockchain using Remix IDE, Truffle, or any other Ethereum development tool.
-Simply copy the contract code and deploy it using your preferred method.

###Executing program
-After deploying the contract, you can interact with it through Ethereum transactions.
-Use the mint function to create new tokens and the burn function to remove existing tokens from circulation.
